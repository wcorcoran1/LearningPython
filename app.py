# use Variables without let or const
# print is like using console.log for JS
# input lets you use data you put on the terminal that is stored for use later
# int converts strings to intergers, float is like int but lets you use decimals
# 

# name = input("what is your name? ")
# print("Hello " + name)

first = input("First: ")
second = input("Second: ")
sum = int(first) + float(second)
print("Sum: " + str(sum))
